#### (Formerly known as CODING-PRACTICE)

This repository contains programming problems that I practice/tackle with my students.

Problems comes from various sources, such as LeetCode (https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/), Cracking the coding interview (Gayle Laackman Mcdowell), TryAlgo Problems (https://tryalgo.org/problems/), BattleDev ISOGRAD (https://www.isograd.com/FR/solutionconcours.php), AtCoder (https://atcoder.jp/contests/archive), Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/archives), Edabit (https://edabit.com/challenges), CSES (https://cses.fi/problemset/)

Be advise that some solutions are not optimal (I am still working on fixing it).
